- What transport protocol do we use?

  TCP

- How does the client find the server (addresses and ports)?

  

- Who speaks first?

- What is the sequence of messages exchanged by the client and the server?

- What happens when a message is received from the other party?

- What is the syntax of the messages? How we generate and parse them?

- Who closes the connection and when?
